# CIS3207 Project 4: Simple File System

## Overview
This project is a simple, inode-based file system. It writes inode structures to a virtual disk and is able to reconstruct them from the disk them after changes have been made.  It supports a small directory hierarchy, the creation, truncation, and deletion of files and directories, among other things. It uses a block size of 4096 bytes and supports a total of 16384 blocks.

See [readme](https://github.com/tuh37046/CIS3207/blob/master/P4_File_System/readme.pdf) for more information<br>

## Usage
